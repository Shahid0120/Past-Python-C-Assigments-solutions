# Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area

# input based and height of the trianle
# process : calculations of hte trangile area
# prints out the area of the triangle

base = int(input("What is the base lenght of the triangle in cm: "))
height = int(input("What is the height of the triangle in cm: ")

Area  = 0.5 * base * height

print("The area of the Trianlge is in cm : %i " %Area))
